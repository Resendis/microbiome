# Microbiome project pipeline

This repo contains the standardized analysis pipeline for 16S and metagenome data. It serves as a testing ground for what will be required to analyze around 500 samples. 

- For suggestions, open questions and bugs please use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/cdiener/microbiome/issues). 
- Different pipelines are managed via branches. The master branch points to the default pipeline.
